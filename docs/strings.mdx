## Concept of strings
The concept of strings is very similar to an array of characters that will make your life much easier. Familiarise with strings and the important STL utilities as much as possible you will be needing them whenever you are dealing with strings. Understand clearly the difference between subarray, substring, subsequence and subset.

:::tip
The following STL utilities for strings in C++ are a must know : length(), push_back(), pop_back(), begin(), end(), substr(), reverse()

## Pattern Searching : KMP algorithm
There are not many algorithms to learn for strings, although there are a few interesting data structures which you will learn about later, KMP is a well known string pattern matching algorithm that will help you avoid TLE with your code. Shared here are some of the best resources to learn about it thoroughly so don’t miss out on this opportunity.
